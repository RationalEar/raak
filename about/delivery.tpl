<p>All goods will be delivered by a carrier and will require a signature on delivery. If you are out when the carrier attempts to deliver your parcel, they will leave a card with contact details for you to arrange a new delivery date. Proof of identification will be required on delivery.</p>

<p>We will make every effort to facilitate the delivery of goods within the estimated timescales. However delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen factors or events outside our control, for example extreme weather, a flood or fire. ZIMALL shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver the products within estimated timescales as we are merely facilitating the process.</p>

<p>Risk of loss and damage of products passes to you on the moment products are delivered to you. We will notify you of the delivery cost during the checkout period.</p>

<p>For international orders, please choose Separate Arrangement so that we can find the best delivery quote for you.</p>

<h3>Zimall Express Delivery</h3>
<p>
Zimall Express Delivery is a low cost delivery system available for all orders made and delivered in Harare. Orders are delivered using Zimall Vehicles and the cost depends on the weight of products. The delivery charge is from $3.50 for the first 5KG and increase by a small factor as the weight increases. Orders are usually delivered within 48 hours depending on the time the order and payment was made. Deliveries are made Monday to Friday.
</p>

<h3>FedEx</h3>
<p>
FedEx (Super Swift (Pvt) Ltd ) is a local Franchise of FedEx Express, an international organisation which currently serves hundreds of cities and markets with its intercontinental and international express services. FedEx fullfils Zimall's deliveries to most major cities in Zimbabwe at reasonable prices ( from $6 on the first KG). Deliveries are made within 48 hours from Monday to Friday. Depending on address, delivery can be made right to the doorstep or else you collect from the nearest FedEx office. In smaller cities with no FedEx Offices, collection can be made at the local post office. 
</p>


<h3>Courier Connect</h3>
<p>
Courier Connect is a logistical and carriage service company that started out as an offshoot of the Zimbabwe Posts (Pvt) ltd.
If you choose to have your order delivered by Courier Connect, you will have to pick up the order at your nearest Post Office.
Delivery times are usually within 7 working days and depend on the date you placed your order and the delivery address. Charges are from $9.00 from the first KG.
</p>

<h3>Free Delivery</h3>
<p>
Free Delivery is a special offer that comes with some products. Free delivery is only available for orders delivered in Zimbabwe or sometimes in Harare only. If your invoice has other products that do not have free delivery, the free delivery offer may sometimes become unavailable. Free Delivery uses Zimall Express Delivery and FedEx service and therefore all the other terms are derived from there.
</p>

<h3>Separate Arrangement</h3>
<p>
Sometimes the system is not able to quote you a delivery fee due to unavailability of third party integrated quote systems. This usually applies to International Deliveries or orders with huge cart weights where the provided shipping methods do not apply. In either case, we need to get a quote from the available shipping companies before you proceed with payment for your order.
