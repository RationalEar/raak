<p>The Site is an online platform allowing for the sale and purchase of items between sellers and buyers.</p>

<p>Membership on the Site is free. <?=$name;?> does not charge any fee for browsing the Site. <?=$name;?> charges transaction fees when an item is successfully sold on the Site, listing fees for adverts and special listing fees to sellers who use the special listing feature for listing their items.</p>

<p>The <?=$name;?> Payments system means that payment for items on the Site may be made online or partly online through the <?=$name;?> payment facilities which <?=$name;?> makes available on the Site.</p>

<p>By providing these payment facilities, <?=$name;?> is merely facilitating the making of online payments by buyers possible but <?=$name;?> is not involved in the process of buying and selling items on the Site. All sales and purchases on the Site continue to be bipartite contracts between the buyer and the seller of an item(s) and <?=$name;?> is not responsible for any non-performance, breach or any other claim relating to or arising out of any contract entered into between any buyers and sellers, nor does <?=$name;?> have any fiduciary duty to any user.</p>

<p><strong>8. Pricing Policy</strong></p>

<p>All prices are inclusive of VAT (where applicable) at the rate appropriate to the country of receipt, and are correct at the time of entering the information on to the system. Prices may change and offers may be withdrawn at any time.</p>

<p>Although we try to ensure all our prices displayed on our website are accurate, errors may sometimes occur. If we discover an error in the price of an item you have ordered we will contact you as soon as possible. You will have the option to reconfirm your order at the correct price or cancel it. If we are unable to contact you, we will treat your order in respect of the incorrectly priced item as cancelled.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. Delivery</strong></p>

<p>All goods will be delivered by a carrier and will require a signature on delivery. If you are out when the carrier attempts to deliver your parcel, they will leave a card with a contact number for you to arrange a new delivery date. Proof of identification will be required on delivery. Deliveries are made Monday to Saturday.</p>

<p>We will make every effort to facilitate the delivery of goods within the estimated timescales. However delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen factors or events outside our control, for example extreme weather, a flood or fire. <?=$name;?> shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver the products within estimated timescales as we are merely facilitating the process.</p>

<p>Risk of loss and damage of products passes to you on the date when the products are delivered to you. We will notify you of the delivery cost during the checkout period.</p>

<p>We are not able to facilitate delivery for orders outside Zimbabwe. International delivery will be coming soon.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>17. Privacy</strong></p>

<p><?=$name;?> takes reasonable measures (physical, organisational and technological) to safeguard against unauthorised access to your personally identifiable information and to safely store your personally identifiable information. However, the Internet is not a secure medium and the privacy of your personal information can never be guaranteed. <?=$name;?> has no control over the practices of third parties (e.g. website links to this Site or third parties who misrepresent themselves as you or someone else). You agree that <?=$name;?> may process your personal information that you provide to it for the purposes of providing the services on <?=$name;?> and for sending marketing communications to you, and that the Privacy Policy of this Site governs our collection, processing, use and any transfer of your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>18. Breach of User Agreement</strong></p>

<p>Without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of <?=$name;?> under this User Agreement or at law or otherwise, <?=$name;?> may immediately and without liability: limit your activity, remove your bids, end your listings, warn other users of your actions, temporarily / indefinitely suspend, limit or withdraw your membership, and/or limit or<br />
<strong>withdraw your access to the Site:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>If you breach this User Agreement;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If <?=$name;?> is unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide; or</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If <?=$name;?> believes (in its sole discretion) that your actions may cause legal liability for you, other users or <?=$name;?>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><?=$name;?> may at any time at its sole discretion reinstate suspended users. A user that has been indefinitely suspended or had their membership withdrawn may not register or attempt to register with <?=$name;?> or use the Site in any manner whatsoever until such time that such user is reinstated by <?=$name;?>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you breach this User Agreement <?=$name;?> reserves the right to recover any amounts due and owing by you to <?=$name;?> or any losses and damages caused by you to <?=$name;?> and to take such steps including legal action and/or the initiation of criminal proceedings against you as <?=$name;?> in its sole discretion deems necessary. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not constitute a waiver of <?=$name;?>&#39;s right to take any actions with respect to that, or subsequent or similar breaches. <?=$name;?> does not guarantee that it will take action against all breaches that there may be of this User Agreement.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>19. Providing Feedback</strong></p>

<p><?=$name;?> encourages buyers and merchants on the Site to provide feedback on each other&#39;s conduct after a transaction has closed; as this helps all users know what it is like to deal with the said buyer/seller. Your feedback will be displayed along with your user ID on the Site. You cannot retract the feedback once you have left it. <?=$name;?> will not be responsible or liable in any way for the feedback that you post on the Site. You agree not to make comments that are not factual in nature including without limitation making any racist comments, using profanity, abusing another user, disrespecting another culture or any other derogatory or inappropriate comments. You further agree not to post feedback in order to solicit sales outside of the Site and not to display contact information of any person within any feedback. If you continuously receive negative feedback ratings, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of <?=$name;?> under this User Agreement or at law, <?=$name;?> reserves the right to suspend, limit or withdraw your access to the Site and/or your membership of the Site.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that your feedback consists of comments left by other users with whom you transact and a composite feedback number compiled by <?=$name;?>, and that together these convey your full user profile. As feedback ratings are not designed for any purpose other than for facilitating trading between the users, you agree that you shall not market or export your <?=$name;?> feedback rating in any venue other than on the Site. <?=$name;?> does not provide the technical ability to allow you to import feedback from other websites to the Site because a composite number, without the corresponding feedback does not reflect your true online reputation within our community.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>20. Withdrawal of Access and/or Membership</strong></p>

<p>Without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of <?=$name;?> under this User Agreement or at law or otherwise, <?=$name;?> may limit, suspend or withdraw your membership and / or your access to the Site at any time, without notice, for any reason, including without limitation, breach of this User Agreement.</p>
