<p>Please note that <strong><u>not all</u> products are returnable and <u>not all</u> shops will accept returns</strong>. For each product we will indicate whether the shop accepts returns or not.</p>

<p>To claim a refund or exchange for any item you are not satisfied with, contact us though our  <a href="https://www.zimall.co.zw/support/index.php?a=add" target="_blank">Customer Support Centre</a>, or our available phone lines elaborating the problem you have with the product. Also include the product name, invoice number, and shop name. This has to be done within the stipulated time of return for a returnable item being delivered to your nominated address. ZIMALL will forward the request to the shop where the product was purchased. If a return agreement is reached please return items in their original condition, unused, in their original packaging, with garment tags and any other security devices still attached within 10 working days. Please do re-use the delivery packaging provided.</p>

<p>This does not apply to faulty or incorrectly supplied goods where your statutory rights are unaffected.</p>

<p>Where lingerie, swimwear, cosmetics and earrings are protected by hygiene seals, you are required to take reasonable care by not removing the hygiene seals. Refunds will not be provided in such circumstances unless the goods are faulty.</p>

<p>Where promotional discounts are applied to orders, the discount will be applied to each item in the basket. In the event of a return, you will not be refunded the discounted proportion. Additionally any complimentary promotional gift given with an order must also be returned if you are returning those goods to which the gift related.</p>

<p>ZIMALL, its officers, employees, agents, affiliates shall not be liable if the store from which you purchased a product fails to return any goods as we are only facilitating the process.</p>

<p><strong>Order Cancellation</strong></p>

<p>If, for any reason, you wish to cancel any order you have placed before it has been delivered or been made available for collection you can cancel the order yourself in the My Account section of the website or submit a ticket at <?php echo anchor(base_url('support/index.php?a=add'), 'Zimall Support Centre', 'target="_blank"');?>. As it is our policy to try to process orders immediately it may not always be possible to stop an order from being dispatched. After dispatch our Returns Policy will apply.
